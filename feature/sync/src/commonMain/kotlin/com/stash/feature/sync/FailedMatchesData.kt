 * Lightweight view model for a user-flagged track — the audio downloaded
 * fine, but it's the wrong song. Sits alongside [UnmatchedTrackView] in the
 * Failed Matches screen so the same resync + preview infrastructure can
 * produce replacement candidates.
 *
 * @property trackId          Primary key of the track in the tracks table.
 * @property title            Original Spotify / YouTube metadata title.
 * @property artist           Original metadata artist.
 * @property albumArtUrl      Original album art, used as a visual anchor.
 * @property currentYoutubeId The currently-associated YT video (wrong one). Often
 *                           null: a lossless download never writes one.
 * @property currentFilePath  On-disk file to delete when the swap is approved.
 * @property searchQuery      "<artist> - <title>" — the plain resync search.
 * @property album            The track's album ("" = unknown). Resync looks in this
 *                           album's tracklist and names it in the search, so a song
 *                           recorded twice (an original and a re-recording) finds
 *                           the right recording; the swap files the file under it.
 * @property durationMs       The track's length, for matching within the album.
