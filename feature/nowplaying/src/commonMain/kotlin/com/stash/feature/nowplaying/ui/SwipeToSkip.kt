/**
 * A horizontal swipe that skips to the next / previous song: shared by the Now Playing art and the
 * mini player, so both commit on the same travel or flick ([swipeSkipOutcome]).
 *
 * The content follows the finger, rubber-banding toward a side with nothing there ([canNext] /
 * [canPrevious]), and fades as it goes. Short of the threshold it springs back. A committed swipe
 * sends it off the side it was pulled toward, calls [onNext] / [onPrevious] (the transport's own
 * ViewModel calls, so the skip logic, the offline guard and Listen Together's routing all apply),
 * waits for the player's new song ([trackKey] changing), and eases the new content in from the far
 * side. With the system's animations removed nothing slides: the skip happens and the content
 * returns to place. Not [enabled] (a Listen Together listener), [gesture] only measures.
 *
 * Callers give the same actions to TalkBack (a button or a custom action): this is touch only.
