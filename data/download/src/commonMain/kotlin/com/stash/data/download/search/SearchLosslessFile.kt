 * That download used to read the cache under the preview's own key,
 * `lossless:<videoId>`, which names the song but not the file. After a preview at
 * one quality (or of a catalog match that later changed), the cache held another
 * file's byte spans and content length under that key, so a download at another
 * quality spliced the two together and stopped at the preview's length: a valid CD
 * STREAMINFO followed by hi-res frames, committed as complete. The path also had
 * none of the codec or length checks DownloadManager applies.
